/*
A JWT, or JSON Web Token, is a open standard used to securely transmit information, including user authentication data, between two parties. It's like a digital identity card that allows a client (like a web app) to prove their identity to a server. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. What it is: 
JWTs are strings of text encoded in JSON format.
They contain information, or "claims," about the user or entity they represent.
These claims can include things like user ID, roles, permissions, and other relevant data.
2. How it works: 
When a user logs in, a server issues a JWT and sends it to the client.
The client stores this JWT and includes it in subsequent requests to the server.
The server can then verify the JWT's authenticity and extract the user's claims.
3. Why it's used:
Stateless authentication:
JWTs allow the server to maintain a stateless authentication system, meaning it doesn't need to store session information on its end. 
Secure communication:
JWTs can be signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity, and can be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to the data they contain. 
Cross-domain authentication:
JWTs can be used across different domains, making them ideal for microservice architectures. 
4. Structure: 
A JWT is typically composed of three parts:
Header: Contains information about the token type (JWT) and the signature algorithm used.
Payload: Contains the claims (information about the user or entity).
Signature: A digital signature that verifies the integrity and authenticity of the token.
5. Benefits:
Improved security:
JWTs can be signed and encrypted to prevent tampering and unauthorized access. 
Statelessness:
The server doesn't need to maintain session state, making it easier to scale and deploy applications. 
Scalability:
JWTs are compact and easy to transport, making them well-suited for microservice architectures. 
In essence, JWTs provide a secure and efficient way for clients to authenticate with servers and securely share information.
