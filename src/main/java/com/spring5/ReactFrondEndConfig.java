Here are some examples of full-stack applications using Java Spring Boot and React:
1. E-commerce Application:
Backend (Spring Boot):
.
Handles product catalog management, user authentication, order processing, and payment gateway integration. Uses Spring Data JPA for database interaction (e.g., with MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Frontend (React):
.
Displays product listings, shopping cart functionality, user profiles, and order history. Uses React Router for navigation and Axios for API calls to the backend.
2. Task Management Application (To-Do List):
Backend (Spring Boot):
.
Manages tasks, user authentication, and data persistence. Uses Spring Boot REST for API endpoints and a database to store tasks.
Frontend (React):
.
Allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Uses React components for task lists and forms.
3. Employee Management System:
Backend (Spring Boot):
.
Provides API endpoints for managing employee data (e.g., name, department, salary), user authentication, and authorization. Uses Spring Security for securing APIs.
Frontend (React):
.
Displays employee lists, allows adding, editing, and deleting employees, and provides search and filtering capabilities. Uses React Hooks for state management.
4. Blog Platform:
Backend (Spring Boot):
.
Manages blog posts, user authentication, and comments. Uses Spring Data JPA for database interaction and Spring Security for user roles and permissions.
Frontend (React):
.
Displays blog posts, allows commenting, and provides user login/registration features. Uses React Router for navigation and Markdown rendering for blog content.
5. File Upload Application:
Backend (Spring Boot):
.
Handles file uploads to a storage service (e.g., AWS S3) and provides API endpoints for managing files. Uses Spring Cloud for cloud integration.
Frontend (React):
.
Allows users to upload files, view uploaded files, and manage file metadata. Uses Axios for API calls and progress indicators for uploads.
Common Technologies Used:
Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, REST APIs, Maven/Gradle, Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2).
Frontend: React, React Router, Axios, Hooks, Component-based architecture, npm/yarn.
Key Considerations:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
Configure CORS to allow the React frontend to communicate with the Spring Boot backend when they are running on different ports.
API Design:
Design RESTful APIs that are easy to consume by the React frontend.
State Management:
Use React's built-in state management or libraries like Redux/Context API for complex applications.
Deployment:
Package the frontend and backend separately or as a single artifact for deployment.
These examples demonstrate the flexibility and power of combining Spring Boot and React for building modern, scalable full-stack applications
