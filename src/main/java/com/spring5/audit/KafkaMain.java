Key Takeaways
Distributed Events: Use Kafka to propagate events across services
    Transactions: Ensure events only publish after successful commits
    Monitoring: Track event metrics with Micrometer
    Actuator: Expose event bus health and statistics
    Resilience: Implement retries and error handling
    Sagas: Orchestrate complex workflows with events

This complete solution provides enterprise-grade event handling with:
    Reliability (transactions, retries)
    Observability (metrics, tracing)
    Scalability (async processing, distributed events)
    Maintainability (clean separation of concerns)
