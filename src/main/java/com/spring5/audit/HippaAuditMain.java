/*
Designing a scalable, HIPAA-compliant auditing microservice for healthcare requires careful attention to security, performance, and regulatory requirements. Below is a detailed architecture and implementation approach:

*/
public class HippaAuditMain {
    
}
/*
1. Key Requirements
HIPAA Compliance
    Audit Logs: Capture all access/modifications to Protected Health Information (PHI) (e.g., who, what, when, where).
    Immutable Logs: Prevent tampering (write-once, append-only).
    Encryption: Data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
    Access Controls: Role-based access (RBAC) to audit logs.

Scalability
    High Throughput: Handle thousands of audit events per second.
    Low Latency: Sub-100ms log ingestion.
    Long Retention: Store logs for 6+ years (HIPAA requirement).

2. Architecture
    High-Level Design
        [Healthcare Apps] → (Audit Events) → [API Gateway] → [Audit Service] → [Kafka] → [Storage]
                                                     ↓
                                              [Real-Time Alerts]
Components
Audit Event Producers
    EHR systems, patient portals, etc.
    Emit structured events (e.g., JSON with userId, action, entityId, timestamp).

Audit Service (Microservice)
    Ingestion API: REST/async (e.g., POST /audit-events).
    Validation: Check for required fields (e.g., patientId, action).
    Enrichment: Add metadata (IP, geolocation).
    Persistence: Push to Kafka for async processing.

Kafka (Event Streaming)
    Topic: audit-events (partitioned by tenantId for scalability).
    Retention: 7 days (hot storage), then archive to cold storage.

Storage Layer

Hot Storage (Queryable):
    Elasticsearch: Fast search (e.g., "Find all accesses to Patient X").
    PostgreSQL: For transactional integrity (backup).
Cold Storage (Compliance):
    AWS S3 + Glacier: Cost-effective, immutable (WORM mode).
Real-Time Monitoring
    Alerting: Detect anomalies (e.g., "5 failed login attempts in 1 minute").
    Tools: Kafka Streams + Elasticsearch Watcher.

3. Data Model
Audit Event Schema (JSON)
{
  "eventId": "uuidv7",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "userId": "dr-smith",
  "userRole": "physician",
  "action": "view",
  "entityType": "PatientRecord",
  "entityId": "patient-123",
  "sourceIp": "192.168.1.1",
  "metadata": {
    "location": "Hospital A",
    "deviceId": "workstation-xyz"
  }
}
HIPAA Fields: userId, entityId (PHI), action, timestamp.

4. Implementation (Spring Boot + Kafka)
Step 1: Ingestion API
@RestController
public class AuditController {
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, AuditEvent> kafkaTemplate;

    @PostMapping("/audit-events")
    public ResponseEntity<Void> logEvent(@RequestBody AuditEvent event) {
        // Validate HIPAA fields
        if (event.getUserId() == null || event.getEntityId() == null) {
            throw new BadRequestException("Missing required fields");
        }

        // Send to Kafka (async)
        kafkaTemplate.send("audit-events", event.getEntityId(), event);
        return ResponseEntity.accepted().build();
    }
}
Step 2: Kafka Consumer (Persist to Elasticsearch)

@KafkaListener(topics = "audit-events")
public void persistAuditEvent(AuditEvent event) {
    // Index in Elasticsearch
    elasticsearchClient.index(
        IndexRequest.of(idx -> idx
            .index("audit-logs")
            .id(event.getEventId())
            .document(event)
        ));
}
Step 3: Immutable Storage (S3)
    Use Kafka Connect to archive logs to S3 in Parquet format.
    Enable S3 Object Lock (WORM) for compliance.

5. Scalability & Performance
Scaling Strategies

Kafka Partitions:
    Partition by tenantId (e.g., hospital ID) for parallel processing.
Elasticsearch Sharding:
    Index per month (audit-logs-2023-09) for faster queries.
Caching:
    Redis cache for frequent queries (e.g., "Last 10 accesses to Patient X").

Performance Metrics
    Component               Target SLA
    Event Ingestion             < 50ms latency
    Elasticsearch Query         < 200ms (p99)
    Kafka Throughput            10K events/sec
6. Security & Compliance
HIPAA Safeguards
Encryption:
    TLS 1.3 for in-transit.
    AES-256 for data at rest (S3, Elasticsearch).
Access Controls:
    RBAC: Only compliance-officer can delete logs.
    Audit Logs for Audit Logs: Track who accessed audit data.
Immutable Logs:
    Hash logs with SHA-256 and store in a blockchain-like ledger (optional).

Audit Query API (HIPAA-Compliant)
    GET /audit-logs?patientId=123&action=view
    Response:
    {
      "events": [ ... ],
      "_links": {  // HATEOAS for pagination
        "next": "/audit-logs?page=2"
      }
    }
7. Interview Questions & Answers
    Q: How do you ensure no audit logs are lost?
        "We use Kafka with acks=all and a persistent consumer group. Events are also replicated to S3 for disaster recovery."
    Q: How would you handle a surge in audit events?
        "Kafka auto-scales with partitions, and we use Elasticsearch rollover APIs to manage index sizes. For extreme loads, we’d pre-warm shards."
    Q: How do you prevent log tampering?
        "S3 Object Lock prevents deletion, and we hash logs with SHA-256. Only a 4-eyes process can override this."

8. Tools & Technologies
    Purpose             Tools
    Event Streaming	Apache Kafka
    Search & Analytics	Elasticsearch
    Cold Storage	AWS S3 + Glacier
    Alerting            Prometheus + Grafana
    Encryption          AWS KMS / HashiCorp Vault
    
Final Notes
    Testing: Simulate load with JMeter (10K events/sec).
    Backup: Daily snapshots of Elasticsearch to S3.
    Cost Optimization: Move logs >1 year to Glacier.

This design balances scalability, compliance, and real-time usability while meeting HIPAA requirements. Would you like a sample Terraform script for deploying this on AWS?
