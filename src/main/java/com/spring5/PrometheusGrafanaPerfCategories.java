I want to track database performance and categorize the performance based on execution time. What are the best database performance indicators to
    categorize the database performance into unacceptable, poor, good, excellent etc using time units if possible

That's a great initiative! Categorizing database performance based on execution time can help you detect bottlenecks early and optimize your system intelligently.

Here’s how you can track, categorize, and interpret database query performance using execution time.

✅ 1. Why Execution Time Matters: Execution time is often the most immediate metric for perceived performance. It reflects:
Query efficiency
Index usage
Locking/contention
Network overhead (for remote DBs)

📊 2. Recommended Performance Categories (Time-Based): You can categorize database performance based on query response time (latency):

    Category        Execution Time (ms)     Description
🚫 Unacceptable      > 1000 ms               Major problem, likely user-visible delay
⚠️ Poor              500–1000 ms             Needs optimization, could hurt performance
🟡 Acceptable        100–500 ms              OK for complex queries, but could be improved
🟢 Good              50–100 ms               Ideal for moderately complex transactional ops
🟢 Excellent         < 50 ms                 Optimized, indexed, possibly cached

You can adjust thresholds based on your use case: OLTP systems should be faster, analytics queries may tolerate higher latencies.

📦 3. What to Measure Beyond Execution Time: To get a complete view, also track:

Metric                      Tool / Relevance
Query execution time        Micrometer, APM tools
Rows returned               Helps identify overly large result sets
Query plan cost             EXPLAIN / EXPLAIN ANALYZE
Index usage                 Missed indexes = slow performance
Connection pool             wait time	High = not enough DB connections
Query frequency             High-frequency slow queries are top priority
Lock time / contention      Use DB-specific views like pg_stat_activity
🔧 4. How to Measure in Spring Boot Use Micrometer with custom timers for DB latency tracking:

@Autowired
MeterRegistry meterRegistry;

public List<Customer> getCustomers() {
    return meterRegistry.timer("db.query.customer.findAll")
        .record(() -> jdbcTemplate.query("SELECT * FROM customers", rowMapper));
}
You can then visualize:

Percentiles (p95, p99)
Count
Average latency
Worst-case latency

📈 5. Using Prometheus + Grafana for Categorization : Create PromQL metrics like:

histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(db_query_customer_findAll_seconds_bucket[1m]))
Set Grafana thresholds using color-coded performance zones:

Red: > 1000 ms
Orange: 500–1000 ms
Yellow: 100–500 ms
Green: < 100 ms

🚀 Bonus: Automate Alerting : With Prometheus AlertManager or Grafana alerts, trigger warnings when:

p95 query latency > 500 ms
Query count > 100/min with > 300 ms average time

Would you like a working Spring Boot + Prometheus example to track DB latency, with categorization? I can set that up for you.
