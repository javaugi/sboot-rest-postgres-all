/**
 *
 * Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing
 * object without altering its structure. This type of design pattern comes
 * under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.
 *
 * This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and
 * provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.
 *
 * We are demonstrating the use of decorator pattern via following example in
 * which we will decorate a shape with some color without alter shape class.

/*
Step 1
Create an interface.
Step 2
Create concrete classes implementing the same interface.
Step 3
Create abstract decorator class implementing the Shape interface.
Step 4
Create concrete decorator class extending the ShapeDecorator class.
Step 5
Use the RedShapeDecorator to decorate Shape objects.


Decorator Design Pattern â€“ Important Points
Decorator design pattern is helpful in providing runtime modification
    abilities and hence more flexible. Its easy to maintain and extend when the
    number of choices are more.
The disadvantage of decorator design pattern is that it uses a lot of similar
    kind of objects (decorators).
Decorator pattern is used a lot in Java IO classes, such as FileReader, BufferedReader etc.
