 * GOF: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access

 *
 * Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to
 * it.
 *
 * Allows for object level access control by acting as a pass through entity or
 * a placeholder object.
 *
 * The definition itself is very clear and proxy design pattern is used when we
 * want to provide controlled access of a functionality.
 *
 * Proxy design pattern common uses are to control access or to provide a
 * wrapper implementation for better performance.
 *
 *
 * In proxy pattern, a class represents functionality of another class. This
 * type of design pattern comes under structural pattern.
 *
 * In proxy pattern, we create object having original object to interface its
 * functionality to outer world.
 *
 * Proxy pattern is used when we need to create a wrapper to cover the main
 * objectâ€™s complexity from the client.
 *
 * Types of proxies
 *
 * Remote proxy:
 *
 * They are responsible for representing the object located remotely. Talking to
 * the real object might involve marshalling and unmarshalling of data and
 * talking to the remote object. All that logic is encapsulated in these proxies
 * and the client application need not worry about them.
 *
 * Virtual proxy:
 *
 * These proxies will provide some default and instant results if the real
 * object is supposed to take some time to produce results. These proxies
 * initiate the operation on real objects and provide a default result to the
 * application. Once the real object is done, these proxies push the actual data
 * to the client where it has provided dummy data earlier.
 *
 * Protection proxy:
 *
 * If an application does not have access to some resource then such proxies
 * will talk to the objects in applications that have access to that resource
 * and then get the result back.
 *
 * Smart Proxy:
 *
 * A smart proxy provides additional layer of security by interposing specific
 * actions when the object is accessed. An example can be to check if the real
 * object is locked before it is accessed to ensure that no other object can
 * change it.
