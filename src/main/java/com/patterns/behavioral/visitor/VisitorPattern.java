/**
 *
 * In Visitor pattern, we use a visitor class which changes the executing
 * algorithm of an element class. By this way, execution algorithm of element
 * can vary as and when visitor varies. This pattern comes under behavior
 * pattern category. As per the pattern, element object has to accept the
 * visitor object so that visitor object handles the operation on the element
 * object. Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a
 * group of similar kind of Objects. With the help of visitor pattern, we can
 * move the operational logic from the objects to another class.
 *
 * For example, think of a Shopping cart where we can add different type of
 * items (Elements). When we click on checkout button, it calculates the total
 * amount to be paid. Now we can have the calculation logic in item classes or
 * we can move out this logic to another class using visitor pattern. Letâ€™s
 * implement this in our example of visitor pattern.
